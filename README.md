# Prediction of Hop Yield

The Hops Yield Optimization Project, sponsored by Agritecture, focuses on maximizing hops production and quality through data analysis and modeling. The primary goal of this project is to develop data-driven insights, statistical analysis, machine learning, and optimization strategies to improve hops yield and quality.




## About the Data
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes information from 2000 to 2022 for three U.S. states: Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The dataset encompasses data on total acres harvested, yield per acre, climate data for all three states, and satellite data containing information like surface soil wetness, moisture, root moisture, and cloud amount. The data is analyzed in three parts, one for each of the three states.

## Goal
To maximize hops yield and quality, the project will employ optimization approaches. The models created will consider the numerous variables and correlations between them. Optimization strategies will be used to suggest best practices for hops production to maximize output and quality while minimizing resource consumption.
## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights for hop growers, helping them make informed decisions, optimize variety selection, and maximize their yield based on climatic conditions. By strategically planning and leveraging the forecasting models, hop farmers can improve operational efficiency and achieve sustainable growth in the hop-growing sector.
